# The function definition
# Before a function can be used, it must be defined. Any function definition begins with the keyword def, short for define. Then comes the name of the function, followed by parentheses and a colon character. This is called the header of the function. After this, indented just like while and if blocks, comes the body of the function.

# For example, the following code defines the function message:


# def message():
#     print("This is my very own function!")


# message()
